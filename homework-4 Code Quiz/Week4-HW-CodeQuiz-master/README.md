# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

I've developed a quiz allowing the user to answer a series of JaveScript questions in a multiple choice setting. The quiz counts down from 75 and ends if the timer reaches zero or the participant answers all questions. Upon entering an incorrect answer, the timer deducts 15 seconds.
